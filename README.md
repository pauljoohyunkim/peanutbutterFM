## To Get Started
Getting started is as easy as simply cloning the repository and running the program.

```
git clone https://github.com/pauljoohyunkim/peanutbutterFM.git

python peanutbutter.py      # Try python3 instead if you have legacy Python.

```

If you are on Windows, currently a minor tweak is needed. This will be fixed at a later time.

If you open pb.conf, you will various configurations. Try tweaking them to see how it affects the program at launch.

(Currently the repository is still under construction.)
